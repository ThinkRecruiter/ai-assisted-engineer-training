# Week 02 Control Flow

    ## Objectives
    - Practice `if/elif/else` logic
- Use `for` loops and list comprehensions
- Write simple input validation

    ## Deliverables
    - `main.py` that converts scores to letter grades
- Add a feature: compute average and highest score

    ## AI Prompt Templates
    Copy/paste and adapt these into your AI assistant. Provide your own context (what you want to build, fields, formats).

    **Prompt â€” Extend logic**
> Given a list of scores, write a function `analyze(scores)` that returns average, min, max, and a distribution dict of letter grades (A/B/C/DF). Add doctests.
