# Week 01 Basic Syntax

    ## Objectives
    - Learn variables, strings, numbers, lists
- Read a CSV and print formatted output
- Understand running a Python file in Replit

    ## Deliverables
    - `main.py` that prints a greeting and iterates over a CSV
- A sample CSV with at least 5 candidates

    ## AI Prompt Templates
    Copy/paste and adapt these into your AI assistant. Provide your own context (what you want to build, fields, formats).

    **Prompt 1 — Explain code clearly**
> I'm learning Python. Create a minimal script that opens `sample_candidates.csv`, loops rows, and prints `"First Last — Title"`. Include comments explaining each line.

**Prompt 2 — Add simple feature**
> Modify the script to count total rows and print `"Total candidates: X"` at the end.

**Prompt 3 — Quick exercise**
> Show me how to split a full name `"First Last"` into first/last variables safely, handling middle names.
