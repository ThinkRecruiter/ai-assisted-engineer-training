This repository is your week-by-week, 6‑month training scaffold. You’ll use Replit (or your local machine) plus an AI pair programmer to ship working tools fast.

## How to use this repo
1. Pick the current week’s folder.
2. Read `README.md` inside that week.
3. Open the code in Replit.
4. Build the deliverables, commit, and (optionally) deploy.

> Language: **Python** (Flask for web). Databases: **SQLite** (upgrade to Postgres later).
